        Sass Main Features:
            - Variables: for reusable values such as colors, font-sizes, spacing etc.
            - Nesting: to nest selectors inside of one another, allowing us to write less code.
            - Operators: for mathematical operations right inside of CSS.
            - Partials and imports: to write CSS in different files and importing them all into one single file.
            - Mixins: to write reusable pieces of CSS code.
            - Functions: similar to mixins, with the difference that they produce a value that can be used.
            - Extends: to make different selectors inherit declarations that are common to all of them. Only use it if the rules we are extending are inherintly and thematically related. 
            - Control directives: for writing complex code using conditionals and loops(not covered in the course).
    

            A Brief Introduction to the Command Line
             dir - See current directory
             cd <directory> - change directory
             cd .. - move up the folder structure
             cls - clear the screen.
             type nul > <document name(s)> - create files.
             move index.js .. - Move files to the parent folder.
             del index.js - remove index.js
             open <file/folder> - open files or folders



             NPM Packages: Let's Install Sass Locally:
              npm init - first step for installing packages.
              npm install <package name> - installing packages. You can add --save-dev so that the package.json file updates and lists this package as one of our developer dependencies(tool we use to develop our project)
              NOTE: DO NOT SHARE THE NODE_MODULES IN GITHUB BECAUSE IT IS TOO BIG. LET THE OTHER PERSON INSTALL THE DEPENDENCIES USING NPM INSTALL.
